// Q7: Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.

console.log(10 - 2);
// Multiplication:
console.log(4 * 2);
// Division:
console.log(16 / 2);
// Q8 - You should create four lines that look like this: console.log(5 + 3) Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

// Q9 - Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.
var favouriteNumber = 10;
var message = "My favourite number is";
